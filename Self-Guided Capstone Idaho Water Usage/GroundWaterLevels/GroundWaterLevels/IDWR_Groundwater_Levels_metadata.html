The Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) maintains a groundwater level database containing data gathered by various sources, including measurements taken by IDWR staff, contractors, consultants, and other public and private entities. IDWR staff periodically measure the depth to water in wells throughout Idaho. Groundwater pressures are also collected in some areas where artesian groundwater systems exist, and are represented as negative values in the time series data (i.e. water pressure is above ground surface). Pressure transducers installed in select wells provide near-continuous water level observations. IDWR strives to generate accurate and beneficial data, and may revise data when necessary. Data can also be viewed, graphed, and downloaded through the IDWR Groundwater Data Portal https://idwr-groundwater-data.idaho.govand additional information can be obtained by visiting https://idwr.idaho.gov/water-data/groundwater-levels/.
